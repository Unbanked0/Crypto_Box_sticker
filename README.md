# Crypto-Box-compact
A nice and standalone way to donate or pay in sovereign cryptocurrency : 
- Monero XMR  [getmonero.org](https://www.getmonero.org/)
- Bitcoin BTC  [bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/)
- June G1 [monnaie-libre.fr](https://monnaie-libre.fr/)

Prefer Monero for it's untraceability and fungibility.
(Avoid Liquid at all costs, it's Paypal2.0)

You can use it to print stickers for your usual local merchants : on the door and on the cashier screen

# Example
For Claudia, a woman who sadly had her house burnt :
